# Github-for-SocialScience
Guide for using Github for social scientists.

This idea for this guide came about when I was working with a team of computer science undergraduate research assistants and we had to collaborate on a large-scale coding task that required close collaboration. Coming from the social sciences, most of my experience to this point was working through cloud services like Dropbox, and doing version control through filenames. In bigger projects, this usually led to more than a couple of instances where important code was lost, forgotten, or broken by stray bits of other code. I knew Github existed and always told myself that I should learn it, but it took some "rewiring" of old habits and assumptions about code management for me to see the light.

This guide is intended to help other social scientists see the benefits of Github, and perhaps even jump on the train. It's a VERY rough right now, and I hope to update it as I go along.
